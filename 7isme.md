## What is it?

7isme aims to provide you with simple and accessible ways to install their own servers, so you can have access to most things you need under a unified umbrella, and with data stored under your control.

Additionally, 7isme aims to teach you how to further protect your privacy with tutorials, software comparisons, and well sourced news.

Everything 7isme does for a price is also available for free, and every script we use is open sourced for you to use yourself. Paying us just makes your life easier and supports us.

7isme promises:
- **ethical business**: We will never put profit before ethics or doing the right thing. It's bad that we're in a world where this needs to be said, but here we are.
- **human relationship**: If you opt to pay for 7isme, you will be put in touch with a system administrator who will personally follow you, learn your likes and dislikes. You will never have to deal with a faceless administration.
- **portable tech stack**: our system should be easy to migrate to different servers, and fairly easy to migrate to different operating systems.
- **transparency**: we lay out flat everything we do. If anything is unclear, we will do all we can to clarify it.

title: Services 7isme provides

The services are detailed below, but in summary, by installing 7isme, you get:
- 

There are several price tiers:
- **one button installation** installs 7isme on a server, and gives you the admin password. You need to setup the domain name yourself. You pay 7isme nothing, but you will have to pay for the domain and for hosting.
- **one button installation + domain name + hosting**:

We will also over time build a knowledge base of how to further escape surveillance and how to educate others.

title: What does "7isme" mean?

It's a geeky play on the `0700` [Unix permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Numeric_notation), which gives full permissions to the owner of the files, and no permissions to anyone else.

It's also a sufficiently short url to be easy to type.

## Why does it Matter?

If you're here, you probably don't need the lesson. But if you need a refresher, or need to convince someone else:

- Facebook is bad, it steals [citation needed]
- Google is bad also it steals [citation needed]
- Google kills services: https://killedbygoogle.com/
- Services that are trustworthy get sold to untrustworthy actors: whatsapp [citation needed], Private Internet Access
- Snowden citation "not caring about privacy..."
- Big companies leak data all the time [citation needed]. See how the data is badly used [citation needed]
- Centralization means single point of failure [citation needed]

Even entire countries, such as [Sweden](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/karloskarbrannstrom_swedish-social-insurance-agency-one-of-the-activity-6603414501897363457-zI2s/) deem storing information on US servers insecure (to the point of forbidding it).

# How does it work?

You choose a custom domain, a server, and click the button. 7isme does this:

1. rents the domain name
2. rents the server
3. sets them up
4. creates an admin account
5. creates a first user account

If you've opted to maintain yourself, all the admin accounts are sent to the email you provide.

If you've opted to let 7isme maintain your services, you'll be appointed a maintainer. This will be the person with whom you'll communicate. They will be responsible of keeping your systems humming and keeping you happy.

# Hardware

7isme can be installed on many different hardware:

title: Regular VPS

The best and most economical solution is to install on a Virtual Private Server. This will be secure and private enough for most users, and will come down to about $12 a month. They will handle a family, a group of friends, or a small company easily (10 \~ 20 users). They typically don't have a lot of space (about 30 gigs total).  
Recommended for:

- users who don't have an vital need for privacy: regular personal users, families, group of friends, businesses without sensitive data

Options to increase power and storage are available, in about doubling ranges, for doubling prices (that is, 40 users and 60 gigs will be about $24 per month). For really large needs, you will want a private server (multiply all prices by 10).

Examples: [Linode](https://linode.com), [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps/)

title: Highly Snooping-resistant VPS

These are VPSes that are located in countries in which privacy laws are very strict, that have a track record of not keeping data, and who can be paid with semi-private currencies such as bitCoin. They are more expensive (about 1.5 to 2 times as much as regular VPSes), but a must for people who care about snooping. They are otherwise subject to the same limitations as regular VPSes.  
Recommended for:

- activists, journalists

Examples: [Bahnhof](https://www.bahnhof.net/), [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/), [OrangeWebsite](https://www.orangewebsite.com/offshore-hosting.php), [FlokiNET](https://flokinet.is/)


title: Super Cheap VPS

These are VPSes that are specially cheap, and don't have enough reputation to form an opinion about their cleanliness. Due to their nature, they are unadvised for mission critical needs, or if privacy is an important matter (Alibaba Cloud is located in China, for example). However, for a group of friends who just want something simple and cheap, they might be the best option.  
Recommended for:

- People who don't want to spend a lot

Examples: [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/world/vps/vps-ssd.xml), [Hetzner Online GmbH](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud), [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/)


title: Your Own Hardware

You can custom install 7isme on any hardware of your choice, but of course, for obvious reasons, we cannot provide you with the 1 button installation, nor can we handle maintenance.

If you do this, your only support is the public forum.

<div class="page"/>

# Development Process

7isme's development runs in an entirely open source agile fashion; Feature development is guided by the needs of users, backed up by actual demand. Paying users, subscribers, and patreons, get more weight in driving feature adoption.

## Revenue Streams

7isme's revenue model is as transparent as possible. We want our incentives, and those of our users, to be aligned. All payments are optional:

1. **An optional fee on installation**: should you decide to use our 1 button installation, rather than install manually, we get paid the sum of $X.
2. **An optional storage maintenance fee**: if you decide to let us handle your storage location, we will add a small markup (10%) on the price of your server's rent
3. **An optional software maintenance fee**: if you decide to let us maintain your server, rather than maintain it yourself, we will get paid a recurrent retainer fee of $X
4. **An optional fee on domain name acquisition**: if you decide to let us buy the domain name, we add a small markup (10%). You can also choose a yourdomainname.7isme.com for free; or bring your own domain
5. **An optional fee on domain name management**: if you decide to let us manage the domain name, we add a small maintenance markup
6. **A fee on customization**: should you want more features than the default ones, tweaks, or branding, we will take a per-project fee, depending on scope.
7. **Donations**: if you like the project, you can donate as a one-off, or a recurrent Patreon donation.

# Who is it for?

This is targeted at:

- Activists & journalists
- Companies that would rather keep their info private
- Individuals who would rather not be snooped on by Google/Facebook etc, but don't have the technical know-how
- People who are afraid services they use today can change/become paid/shutdown
- People who want their services to be all connected and part of the same interface
- People who want to be empowered with new options (such as, for example, creating a new email on the fly whenever needed)
- People who want to have full control over their data, be able to back it up, move it to another country, or erase it entirely as if it never existed.

title: Potential User Cases

1. Instead of using different apps to manage your data, you want a single entry point, where everything is connected. You also want to be able to install new applications, and act on your data in custom ways.
2. You want to be able to port your data, move it around, or be certain that when you delete it, it's deleted for good
3. You want to be able to use software without fear that it will change under your feet, become suddenly non-free, or [get sold to a compromised 3rd party](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivateInternetAccess/comments/dz2w53/our_merger_with_kape_technologies_addressing_your

title: Potential Clients

- SMBs
- Person who wants control over their services
- Person who wants to install Lineage and get out of Google
- Family who wants to share files and pictures
