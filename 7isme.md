# How does it work?

You choose a custom domain, a server, and click the button. 7isme does this:

1. rents the domain name
2. rents the server
3. sets them up
4. creates an admin account
5. creates a first user account

If you've opted to maintain yourself, all the admin accounts are sent to the email you provide.

If you've opted to let 7isme maintain your services, you'll be appointed a maintainer. This will be the person with whom you'll communicate. They will be responsible of keeping your systems humming and keeping you happy.

# Hardware

7isme can be installed on many different hardware:

title: Regular VPS

The best and most economical solution is to install on a Virtual Private Server. This will be secure and private enough for most users, and will come down to about $12 a month. They will handle a family, a group of friends, or a small company easily (10 \~ 20 users). They typically don't have a lot of space (about 30 gigs total).  
Recommended for:

- users who don't have an vital need for privacy: regular personal users, families, group of friends, businesses without sensitive data

Options to increase power and storage are available, in about doubling ranges, for doubling prices (that is, 40 users and 60 gigs will be about $24 per month). For really large needs, you will want a private server (multiply all prices by 10).

Examples: [Linode](https://linode.com), [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps/)

title: Highly Snooping-resistant VPS

These are VPSes that are located in countries in which privacy laws are very strict, that have a track record of not keeping data, and who can be paid with semi-private currencies such as bitCoin. They are more expensive (about 1.5 to 2 times as much as regular VPSes), but a must for people who care about snooping. They are otherwise subject to the same limitations as regular VPSes.  
Recommended for:

- activists, journalists

Examples: [Bahnhof](https://www.bahnhof.net/), [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/), [OrangeWebsite](https://www.orangewebsite.com/offshore-hosting.php), [FlokiNET](https://flokinet.is/)


title: Super Cheap VPS

These are VPSes that are specially cheap, and don't have enough reputation to form an opinion about their cleanliness. Due to their nature, they are unadvised for mission critical needs, or if privacy is an important matter (Alibaba Cloud is located in China, for example). However, for a group of friends who just want something simple and cheap, they might be the best option.  
Recommended for:

- People who don't want to spend a lot

Examples: [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/world/vps/vps-ssd.xml), [Hetzner Online GmbH](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud), [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/)


title: Your Own Hardware

You can custom install 7isme on any hardware of your choice, but of course, for obvious reasons, we cannot provide you with the 1 button installation, nor can we handle maintenance.

If you do this, your only support is the public forum.

# Development Process

7isme's development runs in an entirely open source agile fashion; Feature development is guided by the needs of users, backed up by actual demand. Paying users, subscribers, and patreons, get more weight in driving feature adoption.

## Revenue Streams

7isme's revenue model is as transparent as possible. We want our incentives, and those of our users, to be aligned. All payments are optional:

1. **An optional fee on installation**: should you decide to use our 1 button installation, rather than install manually, we get paid the sum of $X.
2. **An optional storage maintenance fee**: if you decide to let us handle your storage location, we will add a small markup (10%) on the price of your server's rent
3. **An optional software maintenance fee**: if you decide to let us maintain your server, rather than maintain it yourself, we will get paid a recurrent retainer fee of $X
4. **An optional fee on domain name acquisition**: if you decide to let us buy the domain name, we add a small markup (10%). You can also choose a yourdomainname.7isme.com for free; or bring your own domain
5. **An optional fee on domain name management**: if you decide to let us manage the domain name, we add a small maintenance markup
6. **A fee on customization**: should you want more features than the default ones, tweaks, or branding, we will take a per-project fee, depending on scope.
7. **Donations**: if you like the project, you can donate as a one-off, or a recurrent Patreon donation.
