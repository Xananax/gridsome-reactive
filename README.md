# Vue-Remark Blog & Website Template

Uses [Vue-Remark](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/tree/master/packages/vue-remark/) which allows to use components in Markdown (like [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)).

Heavily inspired from [Lauragift's minimal blog](https://github.com/lauragift21/gridsome-minimal-blog) template.

It thrives to provide a complete base to build decent applications easily, while making opting out of features easy-ish.

Additionally, the following niceties are included:

- Templates things:
  - Use [pug](https://pugjs.org/) and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) for templates.
  - Demonstrates adding metadata to `gridsome.config.js` that becomes available on metadata queries.
  - Globally available `<Markdown>` components which *remarks* internal text (plugins don't work with it though). 
- Styles & Themes:
  - Uses the [Stylish](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/stylish) font (edit `src/config/style` to remove).
  - Ready to use icons with [vue-font-awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome). Just use `<fa-icon i="spinner"/>` (or `<fa-icon i="github" size="lg"/>`). Add/remove the icons you want in `src/components/fontAwesome.js`.
- Pipeline things:
  - Generates a sitemap and an RSS feed automatically, which does transform Markdown to HTML (both [gridsome-plugin-rss](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/issues/514) and [gridsome-plugin-feed](https://github.com/onecrayon/gridsome-plugin-feed/issues/2) don't by default).
  - Can load SVGs as Vue components.
  - Favicon automatically generated from SVG Logo (in `static/logo.svg`).
  - Auto-registers all components in the `components` directory. This is probably *not suitable* for ambitious projects, where magic is not desirable. Remove it by removing `src/config/autoLoadComponents`.
- Markdown Handling:
  - Markdown uses [Mermaid](https://github.com/temando/remark-mermaid), [TOC](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc), as well as Gridsome's [PrismJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gridsome/remark-prismjs). Links get nofollow by default.
  - **Note**: While [this issue](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/issues/902) is worked on, you'll have to enter `timeToRead` yourself in the blog posts.

## How to Get Started

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

  `npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Install this starter

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome-starter-blog.git`  
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open folder
3. `yarn start` to start local dev server at http://localhost:8080
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

once you're used to how things work, run `yarn remove-readmes` to get rid of all those README files in subfolders all at once.

If you'd like, run `yarn clean` to remove all Gridsome caches

## Configuration

If you don't want to get too much into details, `content/data.yml` has all the common options you might need.

## Images Handling

to cater for Netlify & co, images that are in `static/images` will be automatically picked up in markdown files, both in the frontmatter, and in image tags.

If you'd like to change the directory, you should change the references to it in both `gridsome.server.js` and `./gridsome/remarkPlugins.js`

## Ready to deploy

- on Gitlab (if you don't want it, remove `gitlab-ci.yml`)
- on Netlify & Netlify CMS (if you don't want it, remove `netlify.toml` and `static/admin`)
