On Android, if you want your contacts to be available to the whole device, you will need an additional syncing app. This is not necessary on IOS, where CalDav is natively supported.

On Android, download DAVx⁵ from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.davdroid) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/). The F-Droid version is free, while the Google Play Store is $2.5; please support the author if you can!  
DAVx⁵ will also sync your calendar.

Similarly, the Simple Contacts Pro app we propose comes from [Simple Mobile Tools](https://www.simplemobiletools.com/). It's also available for free from F-Droid, and paid from the store. Please buy the paid version if you can.
