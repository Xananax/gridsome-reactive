You will own your own social network, which you can use with friends and family on your own server. Additionally, you can connect to any other social network of the [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/). the Fediverse is a *Federated Social Network*. It works a bit like email: gmail users and hotmail users can communicate, despite being on two different domains.

The most prominent app that uses the Fediverse is [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), an app that ressembles Twitter, but differently interesting networks are being created for it, like [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), which ressembles Instagram

Federation allows you to own your own data and not be restricted by any censorship, yet connect to people everywhere like you would in a centralized network such as Facebook.
