Take notes, attach files and image, tag them and organise them. You can write todo lists.

The notes app allows collaborative note editing (you can even invite guests without accounts), complete with side video call to be able to discuss while writing together.

Sync with your Desktop or mobile applications

Rather than a proprietary format, notes are saved as plain text (in a format called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)), which makes it trivial to access and edit the notes anywhere a text editor is available.
