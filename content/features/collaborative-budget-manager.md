Nextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. You can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share money with others.\
It lets you create projects with members and bills. People that are not part of youru network can still be invited to particpate in the project. It also allows you to create recurring bills..
