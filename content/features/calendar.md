A full fledged calendar, complete with events, reminders, and phone syncing. Syncs with any standard calendar application; the applications proposed above are just nominal, you can just continue to use your current calendar application (save for Google Calendar, which is not standard).

On Android, if you want your events to be available to the whole device, or if you want to use Google Calendar, you will need an additional syncing app. This is not necessary on IOS, where CalDav is natively supported.

On Android, download DAVx⁵ from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.davdroid) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/). The F-Droid version is free, while the Google Play Store is $2.5; please support the author if you can!  
DAVx⁵ will also sync contacts.

Similarly, the Simple Calendar app we propose comes from [Simple Mobile Tools](https://www.simplemobiletools.com/). It's also available for free from F-Droid, and paid from the store. Please buy the paid version if you can.

An Alternative Calendar application is Etar ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ws.xsoh.etar&hl=en), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ws.xsoh.etar/)).
