TODO: WRITE DOC

Find a spot to put this:

title: On the Fly Custom Email Address
audiences: activist personal office family
status: stable
description: Create your own email addresses; there's no limit, or rule to how many you or your users can have. Go wild!

Additionally, profit from this to create *spam honeypots*: If your email is bob@example.com, and you're registering to facebook, use bob.facebook.com@example.com. The part after the first dot will be ignored, and you'll be able to create auto-rules to store emails according to your preferences. When Facebook begins selling your email to advertisers, you can easily filter them out.
