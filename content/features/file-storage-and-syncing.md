description: Your own cloud storage

---

Full two-way sync storage. Sync the entire drive, or only selected directories, or both. Share files with collaborators, or publicly. Storage can be encrypted on a per-directory or per-file basis for an added layer of security (at the price of a 31% file size increase and impossibility to edit the files online).

There are [Desktop](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextcloud.client&hl=en), and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nextcloud/id1125420102) apps.

You can set auto-backups of photos and videos.

Additionally to your own storage, you can connect multiple additional providers to your personal drive:

- Amazon S3
- Any Nextcloud instance
- SFTP
- Samba shares
- [PCloud](https://www.pcloud.com)
- [Dropbox](https://github.com/DJaeger/files_external_dropbox/)
- [One Drive](https://github.com/hevelius/files_external_onedrive) (beta)
- [Google Drive](https://github.com/NastuzziSamy/files_external_gdrive/) (beta)
- [Zimbra](https://github.com/ZeXtras/zimbra-drive)
- [Sharepoint](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/sharepoint)
- [Sia Storage](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_external_sia)
- ...And any PC that supports the WebDAV standard

Nextcloud storage is a state of the art solution for cloud storage that leaves no benefit for using others.
